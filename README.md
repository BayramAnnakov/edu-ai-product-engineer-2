# AI Product Engineering Course Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the **AI Product Engineering** course repository. This platform serves as the central hub for all course-related materials, assignments, projects, and collaborative efforts. Our mission is to equip participants with the skills to identify valuable challenges, develop deep domain insights, and architect robust AI-driven solutions.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, participants will:

1. **Exercise Agency in Problem Selection**: Identify and prioritize the most valuable challenges to solve, rather than simply executing predefined tasks.
2. **Develop Deep Domain and Customer Insights**: Engage directly with users, understand business contexts thoroughly, and translate these insights into AI-driven solutions.
3. **Architect Robust GenAI Systems**: Design product workflows where LLMs make on-the-fly decisions, supported by appropriate control mechanisms to manage any unpredictable outputs.
4. **Blend Product and Engineering Roles**: Consolidate responsibilities typically divided between product managers and engineers, enabling faster decision-making and more coherent, user-focused solutions.
5. **Accelerate Feedback and Iteration**: Leverage AIâ€™s rapid prototyping capabilities to gather user feedback, iterate swiftly, and refine solutions that align with evolving market needs.
