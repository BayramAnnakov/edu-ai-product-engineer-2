The app crashes every time I try to upload a photo. Very frustrating!
Love the new interface design, much cleaner and easier to use.
Loading times are really slow, especially on mobile devices.
Would be great to have a dark mode option for night usage.
The search function doesn't work properly, can't find anything.
Excellent customer support, resolved my issue quickly.
App is buggy and freezes frequently. Needs serious fixes.
Great features overall, but could use better navigation.
Performance has improved significantly after the last update.
Missing important features compared to competitors.
