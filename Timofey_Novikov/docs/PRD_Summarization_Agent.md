# PRD: Summarization Agent with Multi-Modal LLMs

## Project Overview

### Objective
Implement an intelligent agent that combines deterministic extractive summarization with probabilistic abstractive summarization using multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide comprehensive text feedback and analysis.

### Vision
Create a robust summarization system that leverages the strengths of both extractive and abstractive approaches, enhanced by multi-modal capabilities for richer context understanding and feedback generation.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Extractive Summarizer
**Type:** Deterministic
**Purpose:** Extract key sentences and phrases directly from source material

#### Features:
- Sentence ranking based on importance scores
- Keyword extraction and frequency analysis
- Topic modeling for content structure identification
- Deterministic scoring algorithms (TF-IDF, TextRank, etc.)
- Configurable summary length (percentage or word count)
- Support for multiple input formats (text, documents, web content)

#### Technical Requirements:
- Consistent output for identical inputs
- Real-time processing capability
- Scalable architecture for large documents
- Integration with preprocessing pipeline

### 2. Abstractive Summarizer
**Type:** Probabilistic
**Purpose:** Generate human-like summaries with paraphrasing and synthesis

#### Features:
- Multi-modal LLM integration for contextual understanding
- Paraphrasing and content synthesis capabilities
- Tone and style adaptation
- Creative summary generation
- Context-aware content restructuring
- Support for different summary types (executive, technical, narrative)

#### Technical Requirements:
- Integration with chosen LLM APIs
- Prompt engineering for optimal results
- Temperature and creativity parameter control
- Fallback mechanisms for API failures
- Cost optimization strategies

### 3. Comparison Report
**Purpose:** Analyze and compare outputs from both summarizers

#### Features:
- Side-by-side summary comparison
- Quality metrics calculation:
  - ROUGE scores
  - BLEU scores
  - Semantic similarity
  - Readability scores
  - Factual accuracy assessment
- Strengths and weaknesses analysis
- Recommendation engine for best approach per content type
- Visual comparison dashboard
- Export capabilities (PDF, JSON, CSV)

#### Metrics Dashboard:
- Summary length comparison
- Processing time analysis
- Quality score breakdown
- User preference tracking
- Content type performance analysis

## Agent Framework Options

### Recommended Framework Analysis:
