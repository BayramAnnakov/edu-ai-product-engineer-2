- **Frontend**: Streamlit for interactive web dashboard
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- **Visualization**: Plotly Express for interactive charts and graphs
- **Environment**: Python 3.8+ with virtual environment management

## Features

### ðŸ“Š Product Analysis
- **Dual Product Selection**: Search by Product ID or browse top products by category
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Total reviews, average rating, first/last review dates
- **Interactive Charts**: Rating distribution histograms and time-based trends
- **Review Explorer**: Paginated review browsing with rating filters
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Extractive summaries, abstractive pros/cons, and thematic analysis

### ðŸ“… Date Analytics
- **Time-Based Insights**: Rating trends and review volume over time
- **Monthly Deep Dive**: Detailed review exploration by month
- **Pattern Detection**: Identify seasonal trends and rating patterns

### ðŸ‘¥ User Analytics
- **User Behavior Analysis**: Review frequency and rating patterns
- **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Identify potential fake reviews
- **Activity Timeline**: Track user engagement over time

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit for web interface
- **AI/ML**: Google Gemini AI (langchain-google-genai) for text analysis
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for data manipulation
- **Visualization**: Plotly Express for interactive charts
- **Workflow**: LangGraph for AI agent orchestration

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google API key for Gemini AI
- CSV dataset with product reviews

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd amazon-review-analyzer
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env file and add your Google API key
   ```

5. **Prepare your data**
   Place your reviews CSV file in the `data/` directory as `reviews.csv`
   
   Expected CSV format:
   - `ProductId`: Product identifier
   - `Text`: Review text content
   - `Score`: Rating (1-5 scale)
   - `Time`: Unix timestamp
   - `UserId`: User identifier

## Usage

1. **Start the dashboard**
   ```bash
   streamlit run dashboard.py
   ```

2. **Access the application**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

3. **Navigate between pages**
   Use the sidebar to switch between Product Analysis, Date Analytics, and User Analytics

## Core Components

### LangGraph Workflow
The application uses a sophisticated AI workflow with parallel processing:
- **Review Fetching**: Extracts reviews for specific products
- **Extractive Summarization**: Selects key quotes from reviews
- **Abstractive Summarization**: Creates structured pros/cons analysis
- **Thematic Analysis**: Groups reviews by themes and topics
- **Final Report**: Combines all analyses into comprehensive insights

### Data Processing
- Flexible CSV column mapping for different data formats
- Robust error handling and data validation
- Efficient caching with Streamlit session state

### Interactive Features
- **Pagination**: Handle large datasets with 5-review pages
- **Filtering**: Sort and filter reviews by rating, date, and themes
- **Product Discovery**: Browse top products by various metrics
- **Real-time Analysis**: On-demand AI analysis with loading indicators
