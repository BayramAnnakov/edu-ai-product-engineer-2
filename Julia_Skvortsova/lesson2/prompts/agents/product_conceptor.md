## Concept Development Guidelines
- **Name**: Should be memorable, relevant, and convey the core benefit

## Important Notes
- Prioritize solving the most painful and frequent user problems
- Consider the personas' contexts and needs when defining features
- Make sure the concept is differentiated from existing solutions
- Focus on outcomes users care about, not just features
