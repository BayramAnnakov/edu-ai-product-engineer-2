Context
 I’m evaluating the following product idea: {{SHORT_IDEA_DESCRIPTION}}

 Goal
 Produce a concise, source‑backed report that tells me whether this idea merits further investment.

 Deliverables & Structure
 1) Problem & Target Users – who feels the pain, how often, how acute? Use quantitative data where possible.
 2) Market Sizing (TAM / SAM / SOM) – show your reasoning; cite authoritative metrics.
 3) Current Solutions & Competitive Landscape – at least 5 direct and 3 adjacent players; summarize their differentiators, pricing, traction.
 4) Customer Willingness‑to‑Pay – reference comparable products, budget line items, and procurement realities.
 5) Regulatory / Technical Constraints – data privacy, compliance, integration hurdles, switching costs.
 6) Emerging Trends & Tailwinds – macro, tech, or behavioral shifts that could accelerate or hinder adoption (with dates & sources).
 7) Risks & Unknowns – top 3 go / no‑go uncertainties and how to test them quickly.
 8) Suggested Validation Experiments – 3 actionable “cheap tests” (e.g., landing‑page smoke test, concierge MVP, pilot with design partners).

 Guidelines
 - Stay neutral; highlight both upside and downside clearly.
 - Use bullets and tables sparingly—only when they make comparisons clearer.
 - Include inline citations (URL + headline + date) for every data point.
 - Aim for breadth first, depth second
 - If critical data is missing, flag it and suggest how to obtain it.
