[WARMUP] QUESTION:
Can you tell us about the last online course you took—how did you approach your study and what motivated you to complete (or pause) it?
----------------------------------------

NASTYA:
The last online course I took was a microeconomics course on a popular platform. I chose it because it was self-paced, which suited my busy schedule with university and commuting. I usually study during my train rides or in the evenings when I have free time. My motivation to complete the course came from wanting to deepen my understanding of economics and also earn a certificate to add to my CV — it helps when applying for internships.

As for my study approach, I break the course into small chunks and try to finish a module or two each session. However, sometimes life gets busy or I lose momentum, and I end up pausing the course for a while. When I come back, I often feel tempted to restart the material to refresh my knowledge, but most courses don’t let you reset progress easily, which can be frustrating.

So a feature like course progress reset sounds appealing — it would let me start over if I want a fresh review and keep my learning organized. But I would want to make sure it’s easy to activate without losing important data or certificates I’ve earned.

  Sentiment: +0.30

SVETLANA:
The last online course I took was an introductory data analytics class on a popular platform, hoping to build a foundation before fully switching careers. I approached it cautiously, since I wanted to be sure this path suited me. I appreciated a structured curriculum and clear milestones because it helped me track progress and stay motivated.

I studied at a slow pace, fitting lessons around my accounting job and family responsibilities. Having some flexibility was crucial. I completed sections bit by bit but paused several times when work got busy or I needed to consolidate what I learned. However, I found it discouraging when I couldn't easily revisit the basics without jumping ahead or restarting the whole course.

So a course progress reset feature sounds useful to me—it would allow me to refresh everything from the beginning once I’m confident or want a review, without losing my previous progress or having to commit to a brand new course. That balance between pacing, flexibility, and control over reviewing material is very important based on how I study and stay motivated.

NIKITA:
The last online course I took was an advanced algorithms class on Coursera. I approached it very systematically—each day after my regular classwork, I dedicated time to watch the lectures, take detailed notes, and solve the programming assignments. I kept a strict study streak going because I really want to stay ahead of my peers and climb the knowledge leaderboard in my CS faculty.

What motivated me the most was the sense of progression and earning badges for completing milestones. I see it as a personal challenge—not just to finish, but to master the concepts. At the same time, whenever I hit a tricky topic or had a heavy week at uni, I paused the course rather than rush it. I prefer to pause and reset my focus instead of burning out or losing the quality of learning.

With a “course progress reset” feature, like ReplayLearn offers, I think it would be handy. Sometimes I want to go back and challenge myself again from the start to reinforce material without it impacting my previous progress or badges. That kind of control feels really valuable for someone like me who thrives on deliberate, consistent training and wants to keep improving.

==================================================

[WARMUP] QUESTION:
Have you ever paused a course or wanted to review material from the beginning? What typically happens in those situations?
----------------------------------------

NASTYA:
Yes, I have definitely paused courses before, especially when life gets busy or when I need to focus on something urgent. Usually, when I go back to the course, I want to revisit earlier material to refresh my memory. Right now, there isn't an easy way to reset my progress, so I have to manually skip or rewatch certain sections, which can be a bit frustrating and time-consuming. Sometimes, I just continue from where I left off, but I worry I might be missing important details from earlier lessons. A reset feature sounds like it could really help me review from the start without hassle.
  Themes: Pausing and resuming courses due to busy schedules, Desire to revisit and refresh earlier course material, Frustration with the lack of a simple progress reset feature, Manual navigation is time-consuming and inconvenient, Interest in a course reset feature to facilitate easier review
  Hypotheses hit: ['H1']
  Sentiment: +0.15

SVETLANA:
Yes, I have definitely paused courses before, especially when trying to balance learning with work and daily life. When I want to review material from the beginning, it’s usually a bit frustrating because some platforms don’t make it easy to reset or revisit the course content from scratch. Often, I have to manually navigate back to the first lesson and try to track my progress carefully, which takes extra time and can be confusing. Sometimes, if the course platform doesn’t support resetting progress, I worry about losing my previous notes or the progress tracking, so I hesitate before restarting.

For me, a feature like ReplayLearn’s course progress reset would be really helpful. It would give me the flexibility to revisit and reinforce important concepts from the start without losing track of my overall learning journey. Clear progress signals and the ability to reset without penalty would make me feel more confident about reviewing and deepening my understanding.

NIKITA:
Yeah, definitely! Sometimes I pause a course when I hit a tough week or have exams in other subjects, and when I come back, I want to reset the progress to review everything from the start. Usually, if there's no reset feature, I end up either skipping most of the material and just focusing on notes or jumping around to important sections. That can get messy and makes it harder to track my actual progress or earn new badges. So having a proper progress reset would be super useful — it’d let me really redo the course and reinforce concepts without the clutter of old incomplete progress or scattered bookmarks.

[DIVERGE] QUESTION:
Imagine you have the option to reset your progress in an online course whenever you want, starting again from scratch—what are your initial thoughts about this feature?
----------------------------------------

NASTYA:
Hmm, the option to reset my progress sounds interesting. Sometimes, if I didn’t really understand something the first time or rushed through parts, being able to start fresh could help me really grasp the material better. Especially since I study mostly on my phone during commutes and at night, it’s easy to lose focus or forget stuff, so resetting might give me a chance to review properly.

But on the other hand, if the course is long or requires a lot of time, I’d worry about accidentally losing my progress or having to redo too much just because of one part I want to revisit. It would have to be easy to control and maybe have some warnings so I don’t reset by mistake.

Overall, I like the idea if it helps me learn better and keep my motivation. But I’d want to be sure it’s not frustrating or confusing to use.
  Themes: Desire for progress reset flexibility, Concerns about accidental loss of progress, Mobile learning constraints and distractions, Ease-of-use and safeguards for reset functionality, Motivation and repeated learning
  Hypotheses hit: ['H1', 'H2']
  Sentiment: +0.30

SVETLANA:
As someone moving into analytics and trying to learn new skills step-by-step, I think this feature could be quite helpful. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed or maybe I rushed through parts and didn’t fully understand them. Being able to reset and start again might let me review things at my own pace without feeling stuck with my previous progress.

At the same time, I would want this to be easy to do and clearly show me where I stand each time. I also hope it doesn't accidentally reset my progress and make me lose track—that would be frustrating. Overall, for a beginner like me who values structured, clear learning paths and wants flexibility, this sounds like a useful option to have.
  Themes: Desire for flexible, self-paced review, Importance of clear progress tracking, Need for beginner-friendly, structured learning paths, Concerns about accidental loss of progress
  Hypotheses hit: ['H1', 'H2']
  Sentiment: +0.60

NIKITA:
Hmm, the idea of resetting my course progress sounds cool in some ways but kinda tricky for me. On one hand, if I want to really master a difficult topic, being able to start over might help me solidify concepts I missed the first time. I’m competitive and always want to push myself, so a "clean slate" could let me challenge myself repeatedly and track improvement.

But on the flip side, I’m worried it might mess with my streak or leaderboard rankings if progress resets erase past achievements. I like seeing how far I’ve come, and sometimes I rely on progress markers to know where I need to focus next instead of redoing everything. Also, if I can reset anytime, I might get tempted to waste time repeating stuff unnecessarily, which doesn’t help me optimize my study sessions.

Overall, if the reset feature is optional and keeps my badges or streak intact, I’d definitely try it for tricky courses. It could become a powerful way to deepen understanding if used wisely.

==================================================

[DIVERGE] QUESTION:
You mentioned wanting easy controls and warnings for the reset option; can you describe what kind of features or safeguards would make you feel confident using a reset button without worrying about losing progress by mistake?
----------------------------------------

NASTYA:
Sure! For me to feel confident using a reset button, I’d want a few clear safeguards. First, a big, clear warning pop-up that explains exactly what resetting means—like, “Are you sure? This will erase all your current progress and you’ll start from scratch.” Maybe even have a second confirmation step, like typing “RESET” to make sure it’s intentional.

Also, a way to back up my progress before resetting would be amazing. Like, if I could save a snapshot or export notes, then reload them later if I want. Or maybe an automatic archive of my last progress state for a limited time, so I could undo the reset within a day or two.

Finally, the reset option shouldn’t be too easy to tap accidentally. So maybe it’s hidden behind a menu or requires a press-and-hold gesture. That would help prevent accidental taps while I’m quickly navigating.

Since I study mostly on my phone during commutes, having these safeguards would really put my mind at ease. I wouldn’t want to lose progress I’ve worked hard for just because I tapped something by mistake.

==================================================

[DIVERGE] QUESTION:
Can you tell me more about how you would expect the 'reset' feature to communicate what will and won’t be erased? For example, would you want warnings, summaries, or checkpoints before confirming a reset?
----------------------------------------

SVETLANA:
For me, clear communication before hitting reset is really important. I would want a warning message that clearly states what exactly will be erased—like my quiz scores, completed lessons, or notes—and what will stay, if anything does. A short summary or bullet points would help me quickly grasp the consequences without guessing.

I also think having checkpoints or a confirmation step is useful, like a “Are you sure?” box with a reminder that this action can't be undone right away. Maybe even an option to export or save progress data externally before resetting would make me feel safer.

Since I’m often juggling work and study, I would appreciate any reassurance that reset isn’t something to panic about but a tool to help me learn better. That way, I could reset confidently without worrying about losing hours of work unexpectedly.

==================================================

[DIVERGE] QUESTION:
You mentioned that you’d try the reset feature if badges or streaks could be preserved. How important are competitive elements like leaderboards and streaks to your overall motivation when learning online, and would you ever trade them off for the chance to improve your mastery?
----------------------------------------

NIKITA:
Competitive elements like leaderboards and streaks are super important to me — they keep me pushing every day and give a clear sense of progress and status among my peers. I actually get kinda pumped seeing my name climb up the leaderboard or when I hit a new badge, so losing those would definitely hurt my motivation.

That said, I also care a lot about truly mastering the material, especially with tough CS topics. If I knew I could reset and replay courses without losing my badges or streaks, that would be ideal. It’d let me deepen my understanding without feeling like I’m throwing away all the proof of my effort.

But if I had to pick only one, I’d probably keep the competitive stuff first. The motivation from competition often helps me stay consistent and put in the work needed to actually master things. So, preserving leaderboards and streaks while allowing resets would make this feature way more appealing for me.

==================================================

[DIVERGE] QUESTION:
Can you describe scenarios where you would (or wouldn’t) want to use a course reset option? What would motivate your choice?
----------------------------------------

NASTYA:
Sure! I would want to use the course reset option mainly when I feel like I didn’t absorb the material well the first time or if I rushed through some lessons. For example, after finishing a module during a busy week, I might realize I need to revisit key concepts more carefully to really understand them. Resetting progress would let me start fresh and focus on mastering the content without feeling pressured by my prior timeline.

On the other hand, I wouldn’t want to reset if I’m using the course mainly for review and just skimming through what I already know. Also, if a course is long and I’m close to the end, I might prefer to just revisit specific sections instead of resetting everything, because that would mean repeating stuff I’m confident about, which feels inefficient.

What motivates me is a balance between efficient learning and solid understanding — I want the reset option available but only for when I genuinely need a restart, not just for repetitive study. Price and time also matter; if I’m paying for the course or managing limited study hours, I’d be cautious about resetting unless it’s really beneficial.
  Themes: Selective use of course reset for mastery, Avoidance of reset due to efficiency concerns, Motivation driven by learning quality and resource constraints (price/time), Differentiation between review and in-depth study scenarios
  Hypotheses hit: ['H1', 'H2']
  Sentiment: +0.20

SVETLANA:
As someone switching from accounting to analytics, I value a structured and clear learning path. I can see myself using a course progress reset if, for example, I completed the course but felt I hadn’t really understood key concepts well enough. Resetting progress would let me start fresh, revisiting lessons with the benefit of hindsight. This would help me reinforce foundational knowledge before moving on to more advanced topics—very important for me as a beginner.

On the other hand, I might avoid using the reset if I’m making steady progress and just need to pause or review certain sections. Resetting in that case might feel like losing all the progress and motivation I’ve already built up. Also, if I’m using free trial periods or open lessons to decide whether to pay, I’d be cautious about resetting too often, so I don’t waste valuable trial time.

In short, the choice to reset would be motivated by my confidence in how well I’ve grasped the material and whether I need a clear fresh start versus just needing to review or slow down. A good reset feature for me would also include warnings or checkpoints so I don’t accidentally lose all my progress without thinking it through.
  Themes: Structured learning path importance, Motivations for resetting course progress, Value of reinforcing foundational knowledge, Concerns about accidental or unnecessary progress loss, Cautious use during trial periods or open lessons, Desire for safeguards (warnings/checkpoints) before resetting
  Hypotheses hit: ['H1', 'H2']
  Sentiment: +0.40

NIKITA:
For me, the course reset option in ReplayLearn could be really useful in a couple of scenarios:

1. When I want to master the material completely — sometimes, even after finishing a course, I notice gaps or parts I didn't fully get. Resetting lets me redo it with fresh focus, which is great for competitive learning and keeping my streak going strong.

2. If the course content has been updated or improved since I first took it, resetting would help me absorb the newest info rather than just skimming through.

3. Also, if I took a course a long time ago and forgot a lot, resetting could be a good way to review from scratch.

On the other hand, I wouldn’t want to reset if:

- I've already earned badges or milestones that depend on total progress or repeated completions — resetting might erase that and feel like losing hard-earned achievements.

- If the course is very long and time-consuming, resetting would be a big time commitment, and I'd prefer to just review specific parts.

Motivation-wise, I’d use the reset mainly when I want to reinforce learning or improve my ranking by proving I can consistently complete the course well. But I’d be cautious about accidentally losing my progress or badges. So maybe a confirmation step or preserving some achievements even after reset would make me more comfortable using it.
  Themes: Use of reset for mastery and reinforcement, Desire to access updated content, Reviewing long-uncompleted courses, Concerns about loss of achievements (badges and milestones), Motivation by competitive ranking and maintaining a learning streak, Need for confirmation or protection to avoid accidental loss, Pragmatic approach for time-consuming content (preferring partial review)

==================================================

[DIVERGE] QUESTION:
You mentioned price and time as important factors—could you share more about how a course reset might impact your willingness to enroll in or pay for online courses? For example, would having a reset option make you feel more confident about purchasing, or would it only matter in specific situations?
----------------------------------------

NASTYA:
Having a reset option could definitely make me feel more confident about paying for a course, especially if I’m on a budget and want to get my money’s worth. Knowing that I can restart and review the material if I don’t master it the first time would reduce the pressure of needing to perfectly understand everything immediately. It gives me some flexibility, which is important since I study during commutes or evenings and sometimes get interrupted or distracted.

That said, it would matter most for courses that are longer or more complex—like when I’m investing a significant amount of time or money. For shorter or cheaper courses, the reset feature might not influence my decision as much, since I expect to just complete or drop those quickly. Overall, if the reset option is included without extra cost or with a reasonable limit, it could be a strong selling point for me, making me more willing to take a chance on a new course or platform.

==================================================

[DIVERGE] QUESTION:
Can you tell me more about what additional features or safeguards would make you feel confident using a reset option? For example, would it help to have the option to back up your progress or restore it if you change your mind?
----------------------------------------

SVETLANA:
Yes, having the ability to back up my progress before resetting would definitely make me feel more comfortable using the reset option. Sometimes, when I’m learning new analytics skills, I might want to start over because I feel I missed important concepts, but I’m also afraid of losing the time and effort I already invested. So, if there was a way to save my current progress as a “checkpoint” or backup I could restore later, it would give me the confidence to experiment with resetting without the fear of losing everything. A simple, one-click restore would be ideal, so it’s not complicated or time-consuming.

Also, it would be helpful if the system reminded me of these backups and maybe suggested I create one before confirming a reset. The more control and safety I have, the more likely I am to use the reset feature when I need it.

==================================================

[DIVERGE] QUESTION:
You mentioned that you'd be more comfortable using the reset feature if some achievements or progress could be preserved. What kinds of progress or badges would you most want to keep after resetting, and how would you like that to work?
----------------------------------------

NIKITA:
The things I’d want to keep after resetting are definitely my badges for skill milestones and my streaks in the leaderboard. Those represent hard-earned progress and status among my peers — if they disappeared, it’d feel like all my effort vanished too, and that would kill my motivation.  

Ideally, the reset should only wipe the course completion data and scores or answers that show how well I’ve learned *this time* around. But if the system could save badges that mark things like “completed advanced algorithms module” or “30-day learning streak” separately, maybe in a special profile section, that’d be perfect.  

Also, I’d love if they could show stats like total hours studied or total problems solved cumulatively even after a reset — that way I see my overall growth, not just the progress in the current run. This balance between a fresh start for mastery and preserving my competitive “rep” would make resetting feel a lot safer and more rewarding.
  Themes: Desire to preserve visible achievements (badges, streaks) after reset, Emotionally attached to progress markers tied to status and motivation, Preference for selective reset (wiping only course completion data/scores, not meta-achievements), Suggested display of cumulative stats (e.g., hours studied, problems solved) for continuous sense of growth, Balancing fresh start with preserving competitive reputation

[DIVERGE] QUESTION:
How does the idea of a course reset compare to what you’ve seen or used on other learning platforms?
----------------------------------------

NASTYA:
The course progress reset feature in ReplayLearn sounds really useful, especially for someone like me who studies on the go and often multitasks during commutes or evenings. On many platforms I’ve used, if you make a mistake or miss something, you kind of have to manually go back or start over, which can be a hassle and time-consuming. Having a dedicated reset option would save time and reduce frustration.

Also, since I like to repeat practice exercises to fully understand them before moving on, being able to reset progress without losing access to certificates or having to re-register would be helpful. Some platforms don’t offer resets and require you to purchase the course again or it simply locks your progress. This can be annoying, especially when budgets are tight and I’m always on the lookout for discounts.

Overall, the reset feature seems like a practical addition that fits well with self-paced learning and would make managing multiple courses easier for me. I’d definitely value that kind of flexibility compared to other platforms I’ve used.
  Themes: Ease of resetting course progress, Mobile and multitask learning scenarios, Avoiding repeat purchases for resets, Maintaining access to certificates, Flexibility for self-paced learners, Comparison to competing platforms
  Hypotheses hit: ['H1', 'H2', 'H3']
  Sentiment: +0.85

SVETLANA:
From my experience with other learning platforms, most don’t offer a full course reset option—usually, they let you review materials or retake quizzes, but your progress stays recorded. The ReplayLearn feature sounds unique and actually quite appealing for me.

When switching careers like I am, it’s common to want a fresh start, especially if you tried a course before and didn’t fully absorb the material. Being able to reset progress would give me the freedom to pace myself properly and not feel held back by any earlier mistakes or rushed attempts.

My main concern would be how the reset works—whether it’s easy to use and clearly signals what data is cleared. I wouldn’t want to accidentally lose progress unless I really intend to start over. Also, I’d appreciate some prompts or confirmation to prevent unintended resets.

Overall, this feature seems very beginner-friendly and aligns with my need for flexible pacing and clarity about where I stand in my learning journey. It could really help me stay motivated and confident in switching to analytics.

  Hypotheses hit: ['H1', 'H2', 'H3']
  Sentiment: +0.80

NIKITA:
From what I’ve experienced, most learning platforms don’t actually offer a proper reset feature for courses. Usually, once you finish a course or pass a test, that progress is locked in, and you can just review content but can’t really start fresh with all quizzes and exercises reset.

ReplayLearn’s idea of a full course progress reset sounds pretty unique and honestly really useful for someone like me who studies almost daily and sometimes wants to redo a course to solidify knowledge or tackle tricky concepts again from zero. It’s a way to challenge myself and not just passively review. It also feels motivating because it can help me keep the streak going by resetting milestones if I want to replay the course thoroughly.

My only concern might be if the reset fully wipes everything, like scores and badges earned, which are things I like to show off in group chats. Hopefully, it gives an option to either keep or reset those as well so I don’t lose all my achievements by accident.

Overall, comparing it to platforms like Coursera or Khan Academy, which don’t have such a feature, ReplayLearn’s reset is a fresh, competitive edge for active learners like me who love repeated practice and beating their own records.

==================================================

[DIVERGE] QUESTION:
You mentioned a concern about potentially losing badges and scores if you use the reset feature. How important are these achievements to your learning experience, and would having customizable reset options (like selectively keeping badges) make ReplayLearn more appealing to you?
----------------------------------------

NIKITA:
Achievements are a big deal for me—they’re like proof of how far I’ve come and what I’ve mastered. They also motivate me to keep going and push harder, especially since I’m competing with classmates on leaderboards. Losing badges or scores after a reset would feel like losing part of my progress story, which is kind of demoralizing.

Having customizable reset options sounds awesome. Being able to choose which badges or skill milestones to keep would make ReplayLearn way more appealing, because I could refresh where I need without wiping out my personal achievements. For example, maybe I reset a course section but keep badges that reflect the skills I’ve already locked in, so I don’t have to start completely from zero every time. That balance would give me the freedom to improve my weak spots while still celebrating my strengths.

Which of these resonate most with you and why?
----------------------------------------

NASTYA:
The theme that resonates most with me is definitely the "Desire for Course Progress Reset and Review Flexibility." As a student who studies mostly on my phone during commutes and evenings, sometimes I don’t get the full grasp the first time through a course. Being able to reset and start fresh would help me organize my learning and really reinforce concepts without clutter.

At the same time, I share the concern about “Accidental or Irrecoverable Loss of Progress, Data, or Achievements.” I’d be worried about losing any certificates or badges I earned, especially since I like to add those to my CV. So, having clear safeguards like big warnings, confirmations, and backups before resetting would be crucial for me to feel safe using this feature.

Also, preserving achievements or streaks after a reset sounds perfect. I want to practice or re-learn tough material, but at the same time, the badges and certificates I’ve earned represent my hard work and motivation for career growth. So if they remain intact while resetting progress, that would encourage me to use the feature more.

Overall, I’d try this feature to help me master courses better and get stronger at topics that matter for my future job prospects, as long as they’re careful about protecting my existing achievements.
  Themes: Desire for course progress reset and flexible review, Concerns about accidental or irrecoverable loss of achievements and progress, Importance of safeguards and warnings before reset, Preserving badges, achievements, and certificates after reset, Motivation to master and reinforce course concepts for career advancement
  Hypotheses hit: ['H1', 'H2']
  Sentiment: +0.65

SVETLANA:
The theme about “Course Progress Reset and Review Flexibility” really stands out to me. As I’m someone switching from accounting to analytics, having the chance to start a course over without the pressure of losing everything would be very helpful. Sometimes I realize I need a fresh start to truly absorb information, especially if I’m going at my own pace and juggling work.

I also strongly relate to the concern about “Accidental or Irrecoverable Loss of Progress.” I get nervous about losing certificates or achievements I earned after working hard through lessons. If the reset could potentially wipe those out without a way to recover, that would discourage me from using it.

Lastly, the “Importance of Safeguards” theme is crucial. A clear warning and confirmation step feel necessary to give me confidence I’m making the right choice. Even better if there’s some kind of backup or ability to restore progress—I’d feel safer experimenting with a reset feature that way.

In summary, the reset feature sounds promising but I would want it designed carefully. Flexibility is appealing as long as my hard-earned progress and credentials stay secure and I’m guided through the process clearly. That balance would make me more likely to try it, especially when reviewing tricky material on my career transition journey.

NIKITA:
Definitely the first and fourth points resonate the most with me.

I’m all about keeping my learning organized and having the option to reset progress sounds super helpful. Sometimes I breeze through a course just to get a gist and later want to properly review it from scratch without messing up my overall flow. So for me, having that fresh start whenever I want would be a game-changer.

Also, preserving achievements like badges and streaks after a reset is huge. I’m very competitive and am proud of my leaderboard position and daily streaks. If resetting resets everything including badges or streak, it might discourage me from using it. But if I can keep those and just clear the course progress, that would make it feel safe and motivating to review hard topics multiple times without penalty.

The warnings and safeguards are important too—because I do not want to accidentally lose months of effort. But overall, a smart, flexible reset that lets me review while keeping my badges and streaks intact is what would fit best with how I study and compete.

[CONVERGE] QUESTION:
If you had to choose between revisiting old lessons one by one or doing a full course reset, which would you prefer, and why?
----------------------------------------

NASTYA:
Given my schedule and study habits, I’d prefer the full course reset option. When I review material, I usually want a fresh start to see the big picture again and check if I’ve really understood everything thoroughly. Going lesson by lesson feels slow and tedious, especially on mobile during commutes. If I could reset the whole course, I could quickly retake quizzes and track progress without too much hassle. Also, resetting feels more motivating—it’s like a clean slate to improve my scores, and that helps me feel confident adding the certificate to my CV. However, I’d hope the reset doesn't erase my notes or important highlights since those help me a lot.
  Themes: Preference for full course reset, Desire for efficient and motivating review process, Mobile-friendly learning considerations, Retention of personal notes and highlights during reset, Certificate-driven learning motivation
  Hypotheses hit: ['H1', 'H2']
  Sentiment: +0.70

SVETLANA:
Given my background and learning style, I would prefer the course progress reset feature over revisiting old lessons one by one. As someone transitioning from accounting to analytics, I appreciate clear structure and the ability to track my overall progress easily. Sometimes, going back lesson by lesson can get tedious and make it harder to see how close I am to finishing.

A full course reset would let me start fresh and review everything in a logical, cohesive way, which is helpful when concepts build on one another. Also, with my busy schedule, I’d want to minimize time spent on navigation and just focus on learning efficiently. However, I’d hope that the reset feature would offer flexibility—so if I only need to revisit specific lessons often, I could still do that without resetting everything. 

Overall, the reset option sounds like a good way to reinforce the material thoroughly, which is important when switching careers, as I want to be confident in the fundamentals.

NIKITA:
Honestly, I'd prefer the full course reset. When I feel like I’ve gotten rusty or want to solidify my foundation, starting fresh helps me catch gaps I might miss by just reviewing pieces here and there. Plus, with something like ReplayLearn, resetting the whole course could rekindle my motivation—kind of like a clean slate challenge to beat my previous streak or score. Revisiting lessons one by one feels slower and kind of tedious when I want to see my overall progress improve quickly. But if I just want to double-check a tricky concept, going lesson by lesson might be useful. Still, as a competitive learner, full resets pump me up more.

[CONVERGE] QUESTION:
How much more likely would you be to repeat a course (for mastery or review) if starting over was just one click away?
----------------------------------------

NASTYA:
As a busy econ student who studies mostly on my phone during commutes, having a one-click reset for courses sounds super convenient. Sometimes I want to revisit tough topics or really master something, but going through complicated steps to restart a course is a hassle and discourages me. 

With ReplayLearn, I’d be a lot more likely to repeat a course because it removes friction — I can just quickly reset and start fresh without wasting time. That’s especially helpful for self-paced courses where reviewing key concepts a few times really helps me retain info. Plus, if I had a certificate from a course, being able to reset it easily means I could polish my skills before applying for jobs or internships.

Overall, I’d say this feature would make me at least 2 to 3 times more likely to revisit a course, which is a big plus for my learning style.
  Themes: Convenience of one-click course reset, Desire for repeated course review for mastery, Reduced friction increases likelihood of course repetition, Utility for self-paced, mobile learning, Certificate value and skill polishing for career readiness
  Hypotheses hit: ['H1', 'H2']
  Sentiment: +0.90

SVETLANA:
As someone shifting from accounting to analytics, I find the idea of resetting course progress with one click quite appealing. For me, reviewing material multiple times is important since analytics involves many new concepts and tools. The simplicity of a one-click reset reduces the friction and hesitation around starting over, especially if I feel I didn’t grasp something fully the first time.

That said, I would want the system to clearly show my progress and what I’ve completed before resetting, so I don’t lose track of where I am. Also, I’d prefer the reset option to be flexible—maybe choose whether to keep some quiz results or notes.

Overall, this feature would make me somewhat more likely to repeat a course, because it feels low effort and encourages mastery. But clear progress tracking alongside it would increase my confidence in using it.

NIKITA:
As someone who studies a ton and aims for mastery, a one-click reset sounds like a really handy feature. Honestly, I often want to review tough courses again to solidify concepts, but sometimes the reset feels like too much hassle or losing my progress discourages me. If hitting reset was literally just one click away, I’d be way more likely to repeat courses regularly—especially when I want to crush the material fully or prep for exams. It’d help me keep my streak and leaderboard ranking strong too, since I could fine-tune my knowledge without losing motivation. So yeah, this would definitely boost how often I revisit courses for me.

[CONVERGE] QUESTION:
Thinking of other platforms you’ve used, would the ability to reset progress make you prefer one over the others? Why or why not?
----------------------------------------

NASTYA:
Yes, I think having a progress reset feature would make me prefer a platform more. Sometimes when I study on mobile during commutes or in the evening, I don’t finish a module fully or realize I didn’t understand a part well enough. Being able to reset progress and redo it from the start would help me really master the material, not just rush through. 

Also, I like to revisit topics just before exams or interviews to refresh my knowledge. On some platforms, if progress can’t be reset, I might have to buy or re-enroll, which is frustrating and expensive. For me, practicing repeatedly until I’m confident is key, so this feature aligns well with my self-paced, practice-focused study habits.

On the downside, I’d want the reset process to be easy and not complicated or irreversible since sometimes I want to keep track of what I’ve done already. But overall, this sounds like a useful feature that could make me choose one course platform over others.

  Sentiment: +0.70

SVETLANA:
As someone switching fields and learning on a beginner-friendly path, the ability to reset progress sounds useful in some ways. Sometimes I try a course and realize it's not a good fit or that I rushed too fast. Being able to reset progress and start fresh could help me practice again and rebuild understanding without feeling stuck or like I’ve wasted time.

On the other hand, I might worry that the reset feature could be easy to overuse, which might slow my overall progress if I’m not careful. I’d want clear signals about what’s worth resetting and how it affects my learning journey. 

Compared to other platforms I’ve used, this feature would make me lean toward ReplayLearn if it’s combined with good guidance and flexible pacing—since I often need to revisit lessons at my own speed. But alone, it wouldn’t be enough for me to prefer one platform over another unless it’s part of an overall well-structured experience.

NIKITA:
Honestly, having a course progress reset feature sounds super useful to me. On platforms I’ve used before, once you finish or even make progress, you often can’t really start fresh, which is annoying if you want to review the entire thing or try a different approach to mastering the material. 

For someone like me, who’s really competitive and tries to keep learning streaks going, sometimes resetting progress can be a way to challenge myself over and over — like replaying a tough level in a game to improve my score. It can also help if I feel like I rushed the course the first time and want to solidify the knowledge properly.

However, I’d want it to be easy to use but with a little warning, so I don’t accidentally lose progress I still want to keep. If the feature is smooth and thoughtful, it might make me prefer ReplayLearn over other platforms that don’t offer this kind of flexibility. 

So yeah, pretty cool idea in my book!

[CLOSURE] QUESTION:
Is there anything about the course reset feature that would make you hesitate to use it or could cause frustration?
----------------------------------------

NASTYA:
As someone who studies mostly on mobile during commutes and prefers self-paced learning, I can see the course progress reset feature being helpful if I want to review material from the beginning. However, I would hesitate if resetting progress meant losing my quiz scores, notes, or certificates earned before. That would be frustrating because I value having proof of completion for my CV. 

Also, I’d worry if the reset was too easy to activate by accident, causing me to lose hard-earned progress unintentionally. So, I’d want clear confirmation steps before resetting. 

In summary, as long as resetting progress doesn’t erase achievements or require extra work to restore, and it’s easy to control, I’d find it useful rather than frustrating. But losing certificates or previous quiz results would definitely make me hesitate.
  Themes: Concerns about loss of achievements (certificates, quiz scores, notes) from reset, Desire for clear confirmation/controls to prevent accidental reset, Interest in reusing/resetting progress for review, Potential frustration if reset causes extra work or loss of proof of completion

SVETLANA:
As someone transitioning into analytics, I appreciate features that let me manage my learning pace well. The course progress reset sounds useful if I want to review material from the start or if I feel I didn’t grasp something properly. But I would hesitate if resetting progress meant losing my notes, bookmarks, or any personalized settings. Also, if the reset could happen accidentally or without clear confirmation, that would be frustrating.

I would want clear warnings before reset and ideally an option to save or export my current progress or highlights. That way, I wouldn’t feel like all my effort could disappear suddenly. Also, knowing if resetting affects only the current course or if it influences any certifications or records would be important to me.

Overall, the idea is promising, but control and safety around resetting progress would be key for me to use it comfortably.

NIKITA:
As someone who takes pride in maintaining a long learning streak and competing on knowledge leaderboards, the course progress reset feature could be a bit tricky for me. I might hesitate to use it because resetting progress could wipe out all my hard-earned milestones and streaks, which are super motivating for me. If the reset isn’t reversible or doesn’t save a backup of my current progress, that could be really frustrating. I’d worry about accidentally hitting the reset and losing days or weeks of consistent work. On the other hand, if it allowed me to challenge myself by replaying content with some sort of checkpoint or partial progress preserved, that would be more appealing. But a simple "all or nothing" reset might make me cautious.

NASTYA:
As someone who studies on the go and often revisits courses to reinforce tricky concepts, I actually like the idea of a course progress reset feature. Sometimes I rush through stuff during commutes and don’t fully grasp it, so being able to reset and redo the course at my own pace sounds really useful. It’s also great for practice and review before exams.

That said, I’d want to know how easy it is to reset and if my previous progress or notes are saved somewhere. If it’s clunky or erases valuable notes, that might be frustrating.

Overall, I’d be pretty likely to recommend a platform with this feature to friends, especially if they’re like me and prefer self-paced, flexible learning with the option to revisit material. It shows the platform cares about long-term learning, not just completion.

As someone who’s transitioning from accounting to analytics, I value clear progress and structure in a course. A course progress reset feature sounds useful if, for example, I want to revisit a course from the beginning after some time or if I feel I didn’t understand parts well enough the first time. It would let me refresh my knowledge without confusion about what I’ve completed.

However, I’d want to be sure it’s easy to use and doesn’t accidentally reset my progress without warning. Also, I tend to follow a course carefully and appreciate seeing my progress to stay motivated, so resetting progress wouldn’t be something I’d do often.

Overall, I think I would recommend a platform with this feature to a friend or colleague if it is well implemented and combined with clear progress tracking. It shows the platform cares about flexible learning, which appeals to me as someone who likes to pace myself and review content thoroughly before moving on.

Honestly, I see both good and bad sides to this. On one hand, having a course progress reset feature could be really useful if I want to revisit a course from scratch—like if I feel I rushed through it before or need to improve my fundamentals. It’s nice for deepening mastery, which fits my competitive and almost-daily study routine.

But on the flip side, I might worry about losing track of my overall progress or messing with my learning streak stats if it resets everything. I’m the type who likes seeing my progress and leaderboard standing grow over time, so this could feel like a step backward if not handled carefully.

Overall, I’d say I’m moderately likely to recommend it to classmates who want that flexibility, especially if the platform lets you toggle the reset without losing other achievements. For me personally, it’s a solid feature but not a must-have.

[CLOSURE] QUESTION:
What, if anything, feels risky or unclear about the idea of letting users reset their progress? What would you want to know before using it?
----------------------------------------

NASTYA:
As a student who studies mostly on mobile during commutes and evenings, the idea of being able to reset my course progress sounds useful—like if I want to review the material from scratch or if I feel I didn’t fully understand a topic the first time through. But it also feels a little risky because I wouldn’t want to accidentally erase hard-earned progress and lose my place or any certificates I might be close to earning.

Before using it, I’d want to know exactly what "reset" means here. Does it erase all my answers, quiz results, and notes? Can I undo or recover my progress after resetting, or is it permanent? Also, will resetting affect any certificates or badges I already earned for the course? Finally, I’d want to know if the reset feature includes any warnings or confirmation steps to prevent mistakes.

If I can be confident that resetting progress is safe and reversible, and that it won’t wipe out any earned certificates, I’d probably use this feature when I want to relearn material thoroughly. Without that clarity, I’d be too nervous to try it.

  Sentiment: +0.10

SVETLANA:
From my perspective as someone switching careers and relying a lot on structured learning paths, the idea of resetting progress sounds both helpful and a bit worrying.

On the positive side, it could be great to restart if I didn’t understand the material well or want to try from the beginning at my own pace. Sometimes I rush through and don’t really absorb things, so resetting might help me reinforce knowledge without paying again.

But what feels risky or unclear is: 
- Will resetting mean losing all my notes, highlights, or personalized settings? That would be frustrating.
- Can I undo a reset if I accidentally trigger it? I’d want a clear confirmation step.
- Will the reset affect any certificates or badges I've earned? That could lower my motivation.
- How often can I reset? Unlimited or limited times?

Before using it, I’d want clear information about exactly what resets — just progress checkpoints, or also quizzes, notes, and rewards? Transparency on these points would help me feel confident using the feature without fear of losing important achievements or data.
  Themes: Desire for clarity and transparency in reset feature (details on what data is affected), Concerns about accidental loss of notes, highlights, settings, badges, or certificates, Need for confirmation and undo option before finalizing a reset, Value in restarting learning for deeper understanding and flexible pacing

NIKITA:
As a competitive first-year CS student, the idea of resetting course progress sounds useful for reviewing tough material or redoing a course to cement knowledge. But what feels risky is accidentally hitting reset and losing all my tracked progress, streaks, and earned badges—that would be super frustrating after maintaining my daily study record. 

I’d want to know if there’s a confirmation step or maybe an option to back up my current progress before resetting. Also, does the reset wipe out all the quizzes, coding challenges, or leaderboard points associated with the course? Lastly, can I selectively reset parts of the course, or is it all or nothing? 

If these details are clear and there’s protection against accidental resets, I’d definitely consider using this feature to improve my understanding on tricky topics or redo sections for better mastery. Otherwise, I’d be cautious about pressing that reset button.
