        "question": "Can you tell us about the last online course you took—how did you approach your study and what motivated you to complete (or pause) it?",
        "response": "The last online course I took was a microeconomics course on a popular platform. I chose it because it was self-paced, which suited my busy schedule with university and commuting. I usually study during my train rides or in the evenings when I have free time. My motivation to complete the course came from wanting to deepen my understanding of economics and also earn a certificate to add to my CV — it helps when applying for internships.\n\nAs for my study approach, I break the course into small chunks and try to finish a module or two each session. However, sometimes life gets busy or I lose momentum, and I end up pausing the course for a while. When I come back, I often feel tempted to restart the material to refresh my knowledge, but most courses don’t let you reset progress easily, which can be frustrating.\n\nSo a feature like course progress reset sounds appealing — it would let me start over if I want a fresh review and keep my learning organized. But I would want to make sure it’s easy to activate without losing important data or certificates I’ve earned.",

        "response": "Yes, I have definitely paused courses before, especially when life gets busy or when I need to focus on something urgent. Usually, when I go back to the course, I want to revisit earlier material to refresh my memory. Right now, there isn't an easy way to reset my progress, so I have to manually skip or rewatch certain sections, which can be a bit frustrating and time-consuming. Sometimes, I just continue from where I left off, but I worry I might be missing important details from earlier lessons. A reset feature sounds like it could really help me review from the start without hassle.",

        "response": "Hmm, the option to reset my progress sounds interesting. Sometimes, if I didn’t really understand something the first time or rushed through parts, being able to start fresh could help me really grasp the material better. Especially since I study mostly on my phone during commutes and at night, it’s easy to lose focus or forget stuff, so resetting might give me a chance to review properly.\n\nBut on the other hand, if the course is long or requires a lot of time, I’d worry about accidentally losing my progress or having to redo too much just because of one part I want to revisit. It would have to be easy to control and maybe have some warnings so I don’t reset by mistake.\n\nOverall, I like the idea if it helps me learn better and keep my motivation. But I’d want to be sure it’s not frustrating or confusing to use.",

        "response": "Sure! For me to feel confident using a reset button, I’d want a few clear safeguards. First, a big, clear warning pop-up that explains exactly what resetting means—like, “Are you sure? This will erase all your current progress and you’ll start from scratch.” Maybe even have a second confirmation step, like typing “RESET” to make sure it’s intentional.\n\nAlso, a way to back up my progress before resetting would be amazing. Like, if I could save a snapshot or export notes, then reload them later if I want. Or maybe an automatic archive of my last progress state for a limited time, so I could undo the reset within a day or two.\n\nFinally, the reset option shouldn’t be too easy to tap accidentally. So maybe it’s hidden behind a menu or requires a press-and-hold gesture. That would help prevent accidental taps while I’m quickly navigating.\n\nSince I study mostly on my phone during commutes, having these safeguards would really put my mind at ease. I wouldn’t want to lose progress I’ve worked hard for just because I tapped something by mistake.",

        "question": "Can you describe scenarios where you would (or wouldn’t) want to use a course reset option? What would motivate your choice?",
        "response": "Sure! I would want to use the course reset option mainly when I feel like I didn’t absorb the material well the first time or if I rushed through some lessons. For example, after finishing a module during a busy week, I might realize I need to revisit key concepts more carefully to really understand them. Resetting progress would let me start fresh and focus on mastering the content without feeling pressured by my prior timeline.\n\nOn the other hand, I wouldn’t want to reset if I’m using the course mainly for review and just skimming through what I already know. Also, if a course is long and I’m close to the end, I might prefer to just revisit specific sections instead of resetting everything, because that would mean repeating stuff I’m confident about, which feels inefficient.\n\nWhat motivates me is a balance between efficient learning and solid understanding — I want the reset option available but only for when I genuinely need a restart, not just for repetitive study. Price and time also matter; if I’m paying for the course or managing limited study hours, I’d be cautious about resetting unless it’s really beneficial.",

For example, would having a reset option make you feel more confident about purchasing, or would it only matter in specific situations?",
        "response": "Having a reset option could definitely make me feel more confident about paying for a course, especially if I’m on a budget and want to get my money’s worth. Knowing that I can restart and review the material if I don’t master it the first time would reduce the pressure of needing to perfectly understand everything immediately. It gives me some flexibility, which is important since I study during commutes or evenings and sometimes get interrupted or distracted.\n\nThat said, it would matter most for courses that are longer or more complex—like when I’m investing a significant amount of time or money. For shorter or cheaper courses, the reset feature might not influence my decision as much, since I expect to just complete or drop those quickly. Overall, if the reset option is included without extra cost or with a reasonable limit, it could be a strong selling point for me, making me more willing to take a chance on a new course or platform.",

        "question": "How does the idea of a course reset compare to what you’ve seen or used on other learning platforms?",
        "response": "The course progress reset feature in ReplayLearn sounds really useful, especially for someone like me who studies on the go and often multitasks during commutes or evenings. On many platforms I’ve used, if you make a mistake or miss something, you kind of have to manually go back or start over, which can be a hassle and time-consuming. Having a dedicated reset option would save time and reduce frustration.\n\nAlso, since I like to repeat practice exercises to fully understand them before moving on, being able to reset progress without losing access to certificates or having to re-register would be helpful. Some platforms don’t offer resets and require you to purchase the course again or it simply locks your progress. This can be annoying, especially when budgets are tight and I’m always on the lookout for discounts.\n\nOverall, the reset feature seems like a practical addition that fits well with self-paced learning and would make managing multiple courses easier for me. I’d definitely value that kind of flexibility compared to other platforms I’ve used.",

        "response": "The theme that resonates most with me is definitely the \"Desire for Course Progress Reset and Review Flexibility.\" As a student who studies mostly on my phone during commutes and evenings, sometimes I don’t get the full grasp the first time through a course. Being able to reset and start fresh would help me organize my learning and really reinforce concepts without clutter.\n\nAt the same time, I share the concern about “Accidental or Irrecoverable Loss of Progress, Data, or Achievements.” I’d be worried about losing any certificates or badges I earned, especially since I like to add those to my CV. So, having clear safeguards like big warnings, confirmations, and backups before resetting would be crucial for me to feel safe using this feature.\n\nAlso, preserving achievements or streaks after a reset sounds perfect. I want to practice or re-learn tough material, but at the same time, the badges and certificates I’ve earned represent my hard work and motivation for career growth. So if they remain intact while resetting progress, that would encourage me to use the feature more.\n\nOverall, I’d try this feature to help me master courses better and get stronger at topics that matter for my future job prospects, as long as they’re careful about protecting my existing achievements.",

        "response": "Given my schedule and study habits, I’d prefer the full course reset option. When I review material, I usually want a fresh start to see the big picture again and check if I’ve really understood everything thoroughly. Going lesson by lesson feels slow and tedious, especially on mobile during commutes. If I could reset the whole course, I could quickly retake quizzes and track progress without too much hassle. Also, resetting feels more motivating—it’s like a clean slate to improve my scores, and that helps me feel confident adding the certificate to my CV.

        "response": "As a busy econ student who studies mostly on my phone during commutes, having a one-click reset for courses sounds super convenient. Sometimes I want to revisit tough topics or really master something, but going through complicated steps to restart a course is a hassle and discourages me. \n\nWith ReplayLearn, I’d be a lot more likely to repeat a course because it removes friction — I can just quickly reset and start fresh without wasting time. That’s especially helpful for self-paced courses where reviewing key concepts a few times really helps me retain info. Plus, if I had a certificate from a course, being able to reset it easily means I could polish my skills before applying for jobs or internships.\n\nOverall, I’d say this feature would make me at least 2 to 3 times more likely to revisit a course, which is a big plus for my learning style.",

        "response": "Yes, I think having a progress reset feature would make me prefer a platform more. Sometimes when I study on mobile during commutes or in the evening, I don’t finish a module fully or realize I didn’t understand a part well enough. Being able to reset progress and redo it from the start would help me really master the material, not just rush through. \n\nAlso, I like to revisit topics just before exams or interviews to refresh my knowledge. On some platforms, if progress can’t be reset, I might have to buy or re-enroll, which is frustrating and expensive. For me, practicing repeatedly until I’m confident is key, so this feature aligns well with my self-paced, practice-focused study habits.\n\nOn the downside, I’d want the reset process to be easy and not complicated or irreversible since sometimes I want to keep track of what I’ve done already.

However, I would hesitate if resetting progress meant losing my quiz scores, notes, or certificates earned before. That would be frustrating because I value having proof of completion for my CV. \n\nAlso, I’d worry if the reset was too easy to activate by accident, causing me to lose hard-earned progress unintentionally. So, I’d want clear confirmation steps before resetting. \n\nIn summary, as long as resetting progress doesn’t erase achievements or require extra work to restore, and it’s easy to control, I’d find it useful rather than frustrating.

Sometimes I rush through stuff during commutes and don’t fully grasp it, so being able to reset and redo the course at my own pace sounds really useful. It’s also great for practice and review before exams.\n\nThat said, I’d want to know how easy it is to reset and if my previous progress or notes are saved somewhere. If it’s clunky or erases valuable notes, that might be frustrating.\n\nOverall, I’d be pretty likely to recommend a platform with this feature to friends, especially if they’re like me and prefer self-paced, flexible learning with the option to revisit material.

But it also feels a little risky because I wouldn’t want to accidentally erase hard-earned progress and lose my place or any certificates I might be close to earning.\n\nBefore using it, I’d want to know exactly what \"reset\" means here. Does it erase all my answers, quiz results, and notes? Can I undo or recover my progress after resetting, or is it permanent? Also, will resetting affect any certificates or badges I already earned for the course? Finally, I’d want to know if the reset feature includes any warnings or confirmation steps to prevent mistakes.\n\nIf I can be confident that resetting progress is safe and reversible, and that it won’t wipe out any earned certificates, I’d probably use this feature when I want to relearn material thoroughly.

        "response": "The last online course I took was an introductory data analytics class on a popular platform, hoping to build a foundation before fully switching careers. I approached it cautiously, since I wanted to be sure this path suited me. I appreciated a structured curriculum and clear milestones because it helped me track progress and stay motivated.\n\nI studied at a slow pace, fitting lessons around my accounting job and family responsibilities. Having some flexibility was crucial. I completed sections bit by bit but paused several times when work got busy or I needed to consolidate what I learned. However, I found it discouraging when I couldn't easily revisit the basics without jumping ahead or restarting the whole course.\n\nSo a course progress reset feature sounds useful to me—it would allow me to refresh everything from the beginning once I’m confident or want a review, without losing my previous progress or having to commit to a brand new course. That balance between pacing, flexibility, and control over reviewing material is very important based on how I study and stay motivated.",

        "response": "Yes, I have definitely paused courses before, especially when trying to balance learning with work and daily life. When I want to review material from the beginning, it’s usually a bit frustrating because some platforms don’t make it easy to reset or revisit the course content from scratch. Often, I have to manually navigate back to the first lesson and try to track my progress carefully, which takes extra time and can be confusing. Sometimes, if the course platform doesn’t support resetting progress, I worry about losing my previous notes or the progress tracking, so I hesitate before restarting.\n\nFor me, a feature like ReplayLearn’s course progress reset would be really helpful. It would give me the flexibility to revisit and reinforce important concepts from the start without losing track of my overall learning journey. Clear progress signals and the ability to reset without penalty would make me feel more confident about reviewing and deepening my understanding.",

I would want a warning message that clearly states what exactly will be erased—like my quiz scores, completed lessons, or notes—and what will stay, if anything does. A short summary or bullet points would help me quickly grasp the consequences without guessing.\n\nI also think having checkpoints or a confirmation step is useful, like a “Are you sure?” box with a reminder that this action can't be undone right away. Maybe even an option to export or save progress data externally before resetting would make me feel safer.\n\nSince I’m often juggling work and study, I would appreciate any reassurance that reset isn’t something to panic about but a tool to help me learn better.

I can see myself using a course progress reset if, for example, I completed the course but felt I hadn’t really understood key concepts well enough. Resetting progress would let me start fresh, revisiting lessons with the benefit of hindsight. This would help me reinforce foundational knowledge before moving on to more advanced topics—very important for me as a beginner.\n\nOn the other hand, I might avoid using the reset if I’m making steady progress and just need to pause or review certain sections. Resetting in that case might feel like losing all the progress and motivation I’ve already built up. Also, if I’m using free trial periods or open lessons to decide whether to pay, I’d be cautious about resetting too often, so I don’t waste valuable trial time.\n\nIn short, the choice to reset would be motivated by my confidence in how well I’ve grasped the material and whether I need a clear fresh start versus just needing to review or slow down.

Sometimes, when I’m learning new analytics skills, I might want to start over because I feel I missed important concepts, but I’m also afraid of losing the time and effort I already invested. So, if there was a way to save my current progress as a “checkpoint” or backup I could restore later, it would give me the confidence to experiment with resetting without the fear of losing everything. A simple, one-click restore would be ideal, so it’s not complicated or time-consuming.\n\nAlso, it would be helpful if the system reminded me of these backups and maybe suggested I create one before confirming a reset.

        "response": "The last online course I took was an advanced algorithms class on Coursera. I approached it very systematically—each day after my regular classwork, I dedicated time to watch the lectures, take detailed notes, and solve the programming assignments. I kept a strict study streak going because I really want to stay ahead of my peers and climb the knowledge leaderboard in my CS faculty.\n\nWhat motivated me the most was the sense of progression and earning badges for completing milestones. I see it as a personal challenge—not just to finish, but to master the concepts. At the same time, whenever I hit a tricky topic or had a heavy week at uni, I paused the course rather than rush it. I prefer to pause and reset my focus instead of burning out or losing the quality of learning.\n\nWith a “course progress reset” feature, like ReplayLearn offers, I think it would be handy.

Sometimes I pause a course when I hit a tough week or have exams in other subjects, and when I come back, I want to reset the progress to review everything from the start. Usually, if there's no reset feature, I end up either skipping most of the material and just focusing on notes or jumping around to important sections. That can get messy and makes it harder to track my actual progress or earn new badges.

I like seeing how far I’ve come, and sometimes I rely on progress markers to know where I need to focus next instead of redoing everything. Also, if I can reset anytime, I might get tempted to waste time repeating stuff unnecessarily, which doesn’t help me optimize my study sessions.\n\nOverall, if the reset feature is optional and keeps my badges or streak intact, I’d definitely try it for tricky courses.

I actually get kinda pumped seeing my name climb up the leaderboard or when I hit a new badge, so losing those would definitely hurt my motivation.\n\nThat said, I also care a lot about truly mastering the material, especially with tough CS topics. If I knew I could reset and replay courses without losing my badges or streaks, that would be ideal. It’d let me deepen my understanding without feeling like I’m throwing away all the proof of my effort.\n\nBut if I had to pick only one, I’d probably keep the competitive stuff first.

When I want to master the material completely — sometimes, even after finishing a course, I notice gaps or parts I didn't fully get. Resetting lets me redo it with fresh focus, which is great for competitive learning and keeping my streak going strong.\n\n2. If the course content has been updated or improved since I first took it, resetting would help me absorb the newest info rather than just skimming through.\n\n3. Also, if I took a course a long time ago and forgot a lot, resetting could be a good way to review from scratch.\n\nOn the other hand, I wouldn’t want to reset if:\n\n- I've already earned badges or milestones that depend on total progress or repeated completions — resetting might erase that and feel like losing hard-earned achievements.\n\n- If the course is very long and time-consuming, resetting would be a big time commitment, and I'd prefer to just review specific parts.\n\nMotivation-wise, I’d use the reset mainly when I want to reinforce learning or improve my ranking by proving I can consistently complete the course well. But I’d be cautious about accidentally losing my progress or badges. So maybe a confirmation step or preserving some achievements even after reset would make me more comfortable using it.",

Those represent hard-earned progress and status among my peers — if they disappeared, it’d feel like all my effort vanished too, and that would kill my motivation.  \n\nIdeally, the reset should only wipe the course completion data and scores or answers that show how well I’ve learned *this time* around. But if the system could save badges that mark things like “completed advanced algorithms module” or “30-day learning streak” separately, maybe in a special profile section, that’d be perfect.  \n\nAlso, I’d love if they could show stats like total hours studied or total problems solved cumulatively even after a reset — that way I see my overall growth, not just the progress in the current run.

        "response": "From what I’ve experienced, most learning platforms don’t actually offer a proper reset feature for courses. Usually, once you finish a course or pass a test, that progress is locked in, and you can just review content but can’t really start fresh with all quizzes and exercises reset.\n\nReplayLearn’s idea of a full course progress reset sounds pretty unique and honestly really useful for someone like me who studies almost daily and sometimes wants to redo a course to solidify knowledge or tackle tricky concepts again from zero. It’s a way to challenge myself and not just passively review. It also feels motivating because it can help me keep the streak going by resetting milestones if I want to replay the course thoroughly.\n\nMy only concern might be if the reset fully wipes everything, like scores and badges earned, which are things I like to show off in group chats. Hopefully, it gives an option to either keep or reset those as well so I don’t lose all my achievements by accident.\n\nOverall, comparing it to platforms like Coursera or Khan Academy, which don’t have such a feature, ReplayLearn’s reset is a fresh, competitive edge for active learners like me who love repeated practice and beating their own records.",

They also motivate me to keep going and push harder, especially since I’m competing with classmates on leaderboards. Losing badges or scores after a reset would feel like losing part of my progress story, which is kind of demoralizing.\n\nHaving customizable reset options sounds awesome. Being able to choose which badges or skill milestones to keep would make ReplayLearn way more appealing, because I could refresh where I need without wiping out my personal achievements. For example, maybe I reset a course section but keep badges that reflect the skills I’ve already locked in, so I don’t have to start completely from zero every time.

This will erase all your current progress and you’ll start from scratch.'...\n- Desire to Preserve Achievements, Badges, Streaks, and Competitive Elements after Reset: If the reset feature is optional and keeps my badges or streak intact, I’d definitely try it for tricky courses....\n- Motivations: Mastery, Reinforcement, Career, and Competitive Drive: Motivation from career advancement and certification...\n\nWhich of these resonate most with you and why?",
        "response": "Definitely the first and fourth points resonate the most with me.\n\nI’m all about keeping my learning organized and having the option to reset progress sounds super helpful. Sometimes I breeze through a course just to get a gist and later want to properly review it from scratch without messing up my overall flow. So for me, having that fresh start whenever I want would be a game-changer.\n\nAlso, preserving achievements like badges and streaks after a reset is huge. I’m very competitive and am proud of my leaderboard position and daily streaks. If resetting resets everything including badges or streak, it might discourage me from using it. But if I can keep those and just clear the course progress, that would make it feel safe and motivating to review hard topics multiple times without penalty.\n\nThe warnings and safeguards are important too—because I do not want to accidentally lose months of effort.
