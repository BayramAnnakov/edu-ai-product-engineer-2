Suggest commit message for the git diff.

Create a detailed message of what changed using structured format. Focus on the high level description of the problem it tries to solve, and how it is solved. Don't go into the specifics of the code unless it adds clarity.

NEVER ever mention a `co-authored-by` or similar aspects. In particular, never mention the tool used to create the commit message or PR.
